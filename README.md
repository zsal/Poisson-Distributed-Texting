Poisson-Distributed-Texting
===========================

uses Twilio to send texts messages over poisson distribution

The Story:
--------------
This is a hack I put together for my economics professor's research project at the end of Junior year right around finals.
 
It was used temporarily while the research team worked out the bugs in their existing project.

This ultimately got me a full-time role on his Well-Being research team for senior year. I'm not terribly proud of the code quality but I figured I'd share it anyways.
